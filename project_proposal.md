# Project Proposal for Personal Calendar Assistant

## Objective
To enable auto scheduling, time blocking for personal use, avoid manual management.
Features that good to have:
+ Task management (Todoist) with time management.
+ Auto scheduling (Skedpal) with realtime adjustment.
+ Time tracking (Toggl)
+ Micro habbits tracking (Stride)
+ Fun events calendar suggestion (Google calendar)

## Background
Currently I'm using Skedpal as my task & timeblocking tool, Toggl as my time tracker. The lack of sync between the tools make scheudling 
hard to manage.

## Overview

### Google calendar

+ Api [documentation](https://developers.google.com/calendar/)
